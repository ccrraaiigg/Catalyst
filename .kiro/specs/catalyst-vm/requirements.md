# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Catalyst is a self-hosted Smalltalk virtual machine that runs in web browsers via WebAssembly GC. The system implements dynamic method translation, converting frequently-executed Smalltalk bytecode to optimized WebAssembly at runtime with AI assistance. This creates a high-performance VM that maintains Open Smalltalk compatibility while leveraging modern web technologies and machine learning for optimization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core VM Runtime

**User Story:** As a Smalltalk developer, I want to run the Smalltalk IDE in a web browser, so that I can develop, debug, and deploy Smalltalk applications live in a web page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Smalltalk image is loaded THEN the system SHALL initialize the VM runtime environment
2. WHEN Smalltalk bytecode is executed THEN the system SHALL interpret the bytecode correctly according to Open Smalltalk VM specifications
3. WHEN the VM encounters method calls THEN the system SHALL resolve and execute the appropriate method implementations
4. WHEN memory allocation is requested THEN the system SHALL manage object creation and garbage collection through WebAssembly GC
5. WHEN primitive operations are invoked THEN the system SHALL execute them with correct semantics
6. WHEN class formats are changed THEN the system SHALL update class WASM types appropriately and migrate the running system to a new virtual machine using the new types
7. WHEN the virtual machine implementation is changed in Smalltalk THEN the system SHALL re-create the WASM GC version through decompilation and reinstantiate it in the web page

### Requirement 2: Method Translation Engine

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious developer, I want frequently-executed methods to be automatically optimized, so that my Smalltalk applications run faster in the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a method is executed multiple times THEN the system SHALL detect it as a hot method candidate
2. WHEN a hot method is identified THEN the system SHALL translate its bytecode to WebAssembly Text (WAT) format
3. WHEN bytecode translation occurs THEN the system SHALL generate semantically equivalent WASM code
4. WHEN translated methods are available THEN the system SHALL use them instead of interpreting bytecode
5. WHEN translation fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to bytecode interpretation

### Requirement 3: AI-Assisted Optimization

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want AI to help optimize method translations, so that the generated WebAssembly code is more efficient than basic translation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN method translation is requested THEN the system SHALL optionally consult an LLM for optimization suggestions
2. WHEN AI optimization is enabled THEN the system SHALL send method context and bytecode to the LLM service
3. WHEN the LLM provides optimization suggestions THEN the system SHALL evaluate and apply safe optimizations
4. WHEN AI services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue with basic translation without degradation
5. WHEN AI-optimized code is generated THEN the system SHALL validate it before deployment

### Requirement 4: Performance Monitoring and Comparison

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want to compare interpreted vs translated method performance, so that I can understand the optimization benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN methods are executed THEN the system SHALL track execution time and frequency
2. WHEN both interpreted and translated versions exist THEN the system SHALL measure performance differences
3. WHEN performance data is collected THEN the system SHALL make it available for analysis
4. WHEN translation overhead occurs THEN the system SHALL account for it in performance calculations
5. WHEN performance thresholds are met THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger optimizations
