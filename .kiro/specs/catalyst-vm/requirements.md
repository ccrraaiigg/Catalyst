# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Catalyst is a self-hosted Smalltalk virtual machine that runs in web browsers via WebAssembly GC. The system implements dynamic method translation, converting frequently-executed Smalltalk bytecode to optimized WebAssembly at runtime with AI assistance. This creates a high-performance VM that maintains Open Smalltalk compatibility while leveraging modern web technologies and machine learning for optimization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core VM Runtime

**User Story:** As a Smalltalk developer, I want to run Smalltalk code in a web browser, so that I can develop and deploy Smalltalk applications on the web platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Smalltalk image is loaded THEN the system SHALL initialize the VM runtime environment
2. WHEN Smalltalk bytecode is executed THEN the system SHALL interpret the bytecode correctly according to Open Smalltalk VM specifications
3. WHEN the VM encounters method calls THEN the system SHALL resolve and execute the appropriate method implementations
4. WHEN memory allocation is requested THEN the system SHALL manage object creation and garbage collection through WebAssembly GC
5. WHEN primitive operations are invoked THEN the system SHALL execute them with correct semantics

### Requirement 2: Method Translation Engine

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious developer, I want frequently-executed methods to be automatically optimized, so that my Smalltalk applications run faster in the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a method is executed multiple times THEN the system SHALL detect it as a hot method candidate
2. WHEN a hot method is identified THEN the system SHALL translate its bytecode to WebAssembly Text (WAT) format
3. WHEN bytecode translation occurs THEN the system SHALL generate semantically equivalent WASM code
4. WHEN translated methods are available THEN the system SHALL use them instead of interpreting bytecode
5. WHEN translation fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to bytecode interpretation without crashing

### Requirement 3: AI-Assisted Optimization

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want AI to help optimize method translations, so that the generated WebAssembly code is more efficient than basic translation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN method translation is requested THEN the system SHALL optionally consult an LLM for optimization suggestions
2. WHEN AI optimization is enabled THEN the system SHALL send method context and bytecode to the LLM service
3. WHEN the LLM provides optimization suggestions THEN the system SHALL evaluate and apply safe optimizations
4. WHEN AI services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue with basic translation without degradation
5. WHEN AI-optimized code is generated THEN the system SHALL validate it before deployment

### Requirement 4: Multi-System Support

**User Story:** As a developer working on multiple projects, I want to run several Smalltalk systems concurrently, so that I can work on different applications simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple Catalyst instances are created THEN each SHALL maintain independent VM state
2. WHEN systems run concurrently THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other's execution
3. WHEN memory is allocated in one system THEN it SHALL not affect other systems' memory spaces
4. WHEN one system encounters an error THEN other systems SHALL continue running normally
5. WHEN systems need to communicate THEN the system SHALL provide safe inter-system messaging

### Requirement 5: Performance Monitoring and Comparison

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want to compare interpreted vs translated method performance, so that I can understand the optimization benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN methods are executed THEN the system SHALL track execution time and frequency
2. WHEN both interpreted and translated versions exist THEN the system SHALL measure performance differences
3. WHEN performance data is collected THEN the system SHALL make it available for analysis
4. WHEN translation overhead occurs THEN the system SHALL account for it in performance calculations
5. WHEN performance thresholds are met THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger optimizations

### Requirement 6: Development and Debugging Support

**User Story:** As a Smalltalk developer, I want debugging and development tools, so that I can effectively develop and troubleshoot my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide method execution tracing
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL generate meaningful stack traces with Smalltalk context
3. WHEN bytecode is translated THEN the system SHALL optionally preserve debugging information
4. WHEN development mode is active THEN the system SHALL provide hot-reloading capabilities
5. WHEN WASM analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL generate module dumps and analysis data

### Requirement 7: Web Browser Integration

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want the Smalltalk VM to integrate seamlessly with web technologies, so that I can build modern web applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the VM loads in a browser THEN it SHALL properly initialize with required COOP/COEP headers
2. WHEN JavaScript interop is needed THEN the system SHALL provide bidirectional method calling
3. WHEN web APIs are accessed THEN the system SHALL expose them to Smalltalk code safely
4. WHEN the page is served THEN the system SHALL work with standard web servers and CDNs
5. WHEN SharedArrayBuffer is used THEN the system SHALL handle cross-origin isolation requirements

### Requirement 8: Build and Deployment System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reliable build system, so that I can easily compile and deploy the VM.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL compile WAT source to WASM binary successfully
2. WHEN dependencies change THEN the system SHALL rebuild only necessary components
3. WHEN deployment is needed THEN the system SHALL generate all required distribution files
4. WHEN development server starts THEN it SHALL serve files with proper headers for WASM GC
5. WHEN production deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL work with standard web server configurations
