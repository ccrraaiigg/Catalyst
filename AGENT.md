## Cursor Workflow: Never Fake Anything. Otherwise, Proceed Without Asking, Always Rebuild After Code Changes

Never fake anything. If you find yourself in a situation where there is information missing, DO NOT guess, "mock", or simulate (e.g., DO NOT create Smalltalk method contexts. Only the real VM can do that.) Instead, STOP and ask the user for clarification. Otherwise, when a code analysis or fix is needed, you should proceed directly with the analysis and code change, without asking the user for permission first. Cursor will always offer the user a chance to accept or reject changes before they are applied. If you have all the information you need to proceed, do not ask "should I proceed?"... just do the work.

When you've changed code, always rebuild.

## Using Python

This system's python executable is 'python3', not 'python'.

## WASM Types

The common supertype of Smalltalk objects here is eqref. We never use externref in this project.
If you're going to analyze a WASM module, do it precisely with wasm-tools (parse, validate, dump).

## Stack-Oriented Analysis Checklist

When asked to analyze stack usage or redundant stack patterns (e.g., `local.tee` followed by `local.get`), and only when asked, always:

1. **Grep all `local.tee $var` in the file.**
2. **For each, extract the snippet up to the next `local.get $var`.**
3. **Simulate the stack for the snippet.**
4. **If the value from `local.tee` is still on the stack at `local.get`, flag as unbalanced.**
5. **Aggregate and report all results at once.**

## Rationale
- Treat the user's algorithm as a strict checklist.
- Automate the process for every variable, not just common ones.
- Do not rely on pattern frequency or intuitionâ€”be exhaustive and unbiased.
- Show the checklist, snippets, and reasoning in the report.
- If a user points out a missed case, re-run the algorithm for all items.

**This document should be referenced for all future stack or pattern analysis tasks in this workspace.**
